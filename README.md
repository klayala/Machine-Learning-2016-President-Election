# Machine-Learning-2016-President-Election
This is perhaps my most proudest project. The main highlight I would say is a creative section near the end where we ecouraged to use any tools at our disposals to do something interesting. At the time I was taking a Bayesian course with the same professor and I found Bayesian statistics to be an interesting approach to statistics. I felt that Bayesain was a bit of a challenge to understand completely as an undergrad. Since we were encouraged to use any tool, I created a bayesian decision tree and paired with a gmb boost. To make it Bayesian, I introduced some bais by making an assumption that counties with high "white" populations would go or populations less than the average county population would be won by Donald Trump. This was done using census data. When I boosted the tree, I was shocked and pleased to see that the boosted tree revealed the true decisive variable of the 2016 election. Comments this creative part was praised by the grader who commented "High creativity, Above-average readability, High efforts." Overall I feel this is my most proudest project thus far just because it was so much fun.
